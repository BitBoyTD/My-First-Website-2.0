        I’ve always enjoyed playing sports and love giving a new one a go. Some of the most notable ones I’ve done include: table tennis, soccer, crossfit and volleyball. This year I played soccer for the school with a couple of my friends. I love playing team sports because of all the friendships I make and the people I meet.
